        Not everyone is a J.K.Rowling. But in this program at GW, we help students open their minds and think outside the box. Exercises include expanding sentences, improving grammar and speaking English. Previous classes included teaching the children to use their sense organs to do descriptive writing.

        Children will be introduced to the world of story writing with its different genres. How to develop a story from a basic thread is a hard thing to learn, but we communicate many techniques to the students. This is a new program and innovative ideas will be introduced as the program goes along.
